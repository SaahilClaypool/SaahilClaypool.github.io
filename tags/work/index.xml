      <description>I worked MIT Lincoln Laboratory the summer of 2016 in a group working for the FAA. Here I created a visualization tool to monitor a distributed system of computers as a graph network. This tool helped visualize when a node in the graph failed and what effect this had on the rest of the system.
Details I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory the summer of 2016. Lincoln is a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) that is associated to MIT.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2017 I worked for MITRE, a government research and development summer. I worked on a project called SIMULARITY which worked on creating more realistic cybersecurity training sceneries. The basic idea is this: in the real world, the majority of the people using a computer network are not interested in hacking or defending a system. Thus, cybersecurity test scenarios should reflect this. But, in most cases, there are just two teams, a red team attacking a system and blue team defending a system.</description>
