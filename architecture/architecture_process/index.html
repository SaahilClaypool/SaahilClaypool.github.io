  <h1>Experiments &amp; Architectural Process</h1>

  <p>It sometimes takes working on an application with a <em>bad</em> architectural design to realize that you never want to work on such a project again.
But, <em>how</em> does a programmer make sure their application doesn&rsquo;t become <em>that project</em>?</p>
<p>Design patterns are useful because they give a name to a complex set of logic that crops up in design.
Take the factory pattern for example - you could easily create a sound class building concept without ever mentioning the word &lsquo;factory&rsquo;, but learning about the factory pattern will give you a mental roadmap for how the code <em>should</em> look.
That context can help reduce the cognitive load of building (or maintaing) a code because developers apply their prior knowledge to that chunk of code.
But, for this to work, developers need that prior context to gain that common understanding.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to get this experience design-pattern experience &ndash; courses, books, conference talks &ndash; but I have found that only way for me to <em>really</em> understand an abstract design pattern is to use it in real code.
Someone like me with few life-related responsibilities can maybe get this broad experience from weekend projects, but weekend projects aren&rsquo;t feasible for everyone.
So, an organization striving to improve their development team would need to provide opportunities for <em>breadth</em> in technology experience.
This is most easily accomplished with <strong>experiments</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-experiment-in-software">What is an experiment (in software)?</h2>
<p>Experiments can be conducted by building small, non-critical components using a different approach.
Unliike traditional development, the feature is <em>not</em> more important than the process.
Rather, the goal of the experiment is to to expose the team to a new software pattern, process, framwork or some other new technology.</p>
<p>This way, the next time a problem of real business value needs to be solved, the team will have a wider area of experience to make more informed architectural decisions.</p>
