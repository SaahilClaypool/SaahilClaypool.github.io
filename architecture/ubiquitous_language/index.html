  <p>Ubiquitous Language and the imortance of just <em>agreeing</em> on what to call things.</p>
<h2 id="ubiquitous-language">Ubiquitous Language</h2>
<p>Ubiquitous language might not seem like the flashiest thing to pul out of a software architecture book, but I have found that clearly communicating software requirements has been the distinguishing factor of recent projects I have worked on.</p>
<p>To take a step back, a peice of software is only useful in the way it performs some task (or helps a human perform a task).
The details for how it gets that task done are not nearly as important as the simple question: does the software do what it needs to do.
Within a business, &lsquo;thing&rsquo; the program needs to do is often determined in part business owners, and business owners don&rsquo;t always speak the language as the developers.
One solution to this problem is to create a <em>ubiquitous language</em>: a common language all team members and stakeholders agree upon to refer to parts of the domain.</p>
<p>Take a recent project I worked on as an example.
My team was tasked with creating what our product team referred to as a &lsquo;subscription model&rsquo; for students.
Unlike many models, the payments made by the students would not follow a monthly cadence, but rather be billed to each student by their school semester.
Moreover, the students would not be paying for indefintely for continued access, but rather just a set number of times before they &lsquo;owned&rsquo; the product.
Does that sound like a &lsquo;subscription&rsquo;? No. No it is not so much a subscription as a payment broken into a series of installments, and it took our engineering team a long time (weeks!) to reconcile that this &lsquo;subscription&rsquo; was really a payment quantity split into irregular installments.</p>
<p>This miscommunication went both ways - internally, or engineering team referred to these payment periods as &lsquo;semesters&rsquo; as to us, each payment period aligned with a school semester.
This colloquial usage led us to name our models, routes, and text within pages as &lsquo;semesters&rsquo;.
It wasn&rsquo;t until we met a month or so later with our training team (responsible with educating school-personel about our software) that we realized the err of our ways -
&lsquo;semesters&rsquo; is not the term all schools use to descibe their course run times.
Moreover, our &lsquo;payment periods&rsquo; would not always line up with these &lsquo;semesters&rsquo; or course blocks.
Long story short, we needed to rename all our end-user facing terminology, but we still had all the dangling references to the term &lsquo;semester&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All of this <em>may</em> have been avoided if we had just agreed on what we would call things from the start while we - A ubiquitious language.</p>
